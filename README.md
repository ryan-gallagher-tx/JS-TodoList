# js-todolist
Basic js todolist build by following Gordon Zhu's Watch and Code.
I'm planning to revisit it to mkae it more attractive looking.
I'd like to make the add todo button go in the center of the screen as a big bar, and enable entry by pressing the enter key.
I'd like to enable changing todo contents by simply clicking on them.
I'd like to be able to rearrange todos by clicking and dragging.
I'd like a way to send todo's to email
